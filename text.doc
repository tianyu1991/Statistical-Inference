 exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem
1.	Overview
   In this project, 1000 exponential distributions (lambda = 0.2) are simulated in and each distribution has 40 numbers. The distribution of averages and variables of 40 exponentials are investigated and compared with theoretical mean and theoretical variable of the distribution. Then the distribution is compared with normal distribution.

2.	Simulation
Simulate 1000 exponential distributions, each of which have 40 numbers, and get the averages and variables of the distributions.

lambda = 0.2
nosim <- 1000
n <- 40
nums<-matrix(rexp(nosim * n,lambda),nosim)
dat <- data.frame(vars = apply(nums,1,var),means=apply(nums,1,mean))


3.	Mean
For exponential distribution, the theoretical mean:
 

t_mean<-1/lambda

Plot the distribution of the averages of the exponentials and compared with the theoretical mean.

g <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = means)) + geom_histogram( binwidth=.2, colour = "black",fill = "lightblue") 
g <- g + geom_vline(xintercept = t_mean, size = 1)
  
4.	Variance
For exponential distribution, the theoretical variable:
 

t_var<-1/lambda^2

Plot the distribution of the variables of the exponentials and compared with the theoretical variable.

g <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = vars)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1.5, colour = "black",fill = "lightblue") 
g <- g + geom_vline(xintercept = t_var, size = 1)
 

5.	Distribution
Compare the distribution of means and variables with normal distribution, test the hypothesis that the distributions of means and variables is same as the normal distribution by t-test, z-test.

5.1	Simulate normal distributions
At first, I generated 2*1000 numbers from normal distributions with the same means and standard deviations as the distributions of means and variables. 
s_means<-rnorm(nosim, mean = t_mean, sd =  sd(dat$means))
s_vars<-rnorm(nosim, mean = t_var, sd =  sd(dat$vars))

5.2	t test
t.test(dat$means,s_means,paired=FALSE)
Result:
t = -1.2044, df = 1997.968, p-value = 0.2286
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.11129650  0.02660733
According to the t test result, 0 is contented in 95 percent confidence interval, so the hypothesis that the distribution of means is same as the normal distribution cannot be denied. Thus, the distribution of means is same as the normal distribution. 

t.test(dat$vars,s_vars,paired=FALSE)
Result:
t = -0.2025, df = 1997.997, p-value = 0.8395
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.9910714  0.8055517
According to the t test result, 0 is contented in 95 percent confidence interval, so the hypothesis that the distribution of variables is same as the normal distribution cannot be denied. Thus, the distribution of variables is same as the normal distribution. 

5.3	z test
d_mean<-mean(dat$means)-mean(s_means)
s_mean<-sd(dat$means)-sd(s_means)
d_mean+c(-1,1)*qnorm(.05)*s_mean/sqrt(nosim)
Result:
-0.04218203 -0.04250713
According to the t test result, 0 is contented in 95 percent confidence interval, so the hypothesis that the distribution of means is same as the normal distribution cannot be denied. Thus, the distribution of means is same as the normal distribution. 

d_var<-mean(dat$vars)-mean(s_vars)
s_var<-sd(dat$vars)-sd(s_vars)
d_var+c(-1,1)*qnorm(.05)*s_var/sqrt(nosim)
Result:
-0.09206914 -0.09345057
According to the t test result, 0 is not contented in 95 percent confidence interval, so the hypothesis that the distribution of variables is same as the normal distribution can be denied. Thus, the distribution of variables is not same as the normal distribution.
